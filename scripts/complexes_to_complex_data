=head1 complexes_to_complex_data





Example:

    complexes_to_complex_data [arguments] < input > output

The standard input should be a tab-separated table (i.e., each line
is a tab-separated set of fields).  Normally, the last field in each
line would contain the identifer. If another column contains the identifier
use

    -c N

where N is the column (from 1) that contains the subsystem.

This is a pipe command. The input is taken from the standard input, and the
output is to the standard output.

=head2 Documentation for underlying call

This script is a wrapper for the CDMI-API call complexes_to_complex_data. It is documented as follows:

  $return = $obj->complexes_to_complex_data($complexes)

=item Parameter and return types

=begin html

<pre>
$complexes is a complexes
$return is a reference to a hash where the key is a complex and the value is a complex_data
complexes is a reference to a list where each element is a complex
complex is a string
complex_data is a reference to a hash where the following keys are defined:
	complex_name has a value which is a name
	complex_roles has a value which is a roles_with_flags
	complex_reactions has a value which is a reactions
name is a string
roles_with_flags is a reference to a list where each element is a role_with_flag
role_with_flag is a reference to a list containing 2 items:
	0: a role
	1: an optional
role is a string
optional is a string
reactions is a reference to a list where each element is a reaction
reaction is a string

=item -c Column

This is used only if the column containing the subsystem is not the last column.

=item -i InputFile    [ use InputFile, rather than stdin ]

=head2 Output Format

The standard output is a tab-delimited file. It consists of the input
file with extra columns added in this order: complex_name complex_reactions complex_roles (flag role).

Input lines that cannot be extended are written to stderr.
