=head1 protein_families_to_co_occurring_families


Since we accumulate data relating to the co-occurrence (i.e., chromosomal
clustering) of genes in prokaryotic genomes,  we can note which pairs of genes tend to co-occur.
From this data, one can compute the protein families that tend to co-occur (i.e., tend to
cluster on the chromosome).  This allows one to formulate conjectures for unclustered pairs, based
on clustered pairs from the same protein_families.


Example:

    protein_families_to_co_occurring_families [arguments] < input > output

The standard input should be a tab-separated table (i.e., each line
is a tab-separated set of fields).  Normally, the last field in each
line would contain the identifer. If another column contains the identifier
use

    -c N

where N is the column (from 1) that contains the subsystem.

This is a pipe command. The input is taken from the standard input, and the
output is to the standard output.

=head2 Documentation for underlying call

This script is a wrapper for the CDMI-API call protein_families_to_co_occurring_families. It is documented as follows:

  $return = $obj->protein_families_to_co_occurring_families($protein_families)

=over 4

=item Parameter and return types

=begin html

<pre>
$protein_families is a protein_families
$return is a reference to a hash where the key is a protein_family and the value is a fc_protein_families
protein_families is a reference to a list where each element is a protein_family
protein_family is a string
fc_protein_families is a reference to a list where each element is a fc_protein_family
fc_protein_family is a reference to a list containing 3 items:
	0: a protein_family
	1: a score
	2: a function
score is a float
function is a string

=item -c Column

This is used only if the column containing the subsystem is not the last column.

=item -i InputFile    [ use InputFile, rather than stdin ]

=back

=head2 Output Format

The standard output is a tab-delimited file. It consists of the input
file with extra columns added.

Input lines that cannot be extended are written to stderr.
