=head1 fids_to_subsystems


fids in subsystems normally have somewhat more reliable assigned functions than
those not in subsystems.  Hence, it is common to ask "Is this protein-encoding gene
included in any subsystems?"   fids_to_subsystems can be used to see which subsystems
contain a fid (or, you can submit as input a set of fids and get the subsystems for each).


Example:

    fids_to_subsystems [arguments] < input > output

The standard input should be a tab-separated table (i.e., each line
is a tab-separated set of fields).  Normally, the last field in each
line would contain the identifer. If another column contains the identifier
use

    -c N

where N is the column (from 1) that contains the subsystem.

This is a pipe command. The input is taken from the standard input, and the
output is to the standard output.

=head2 Documentation for underlying call

This script is a wrapper for the CDMI-API call fids_to_subsystems. It is documented as follows:

  $return = $obj->fids_to_subsystems($fids)

=over 4

=item Parameter and return types

=begin html

<pre>
$fids is a fids
$return is a reference to a hash where the key is a fid and the value is a subsystems
fids is a reference to a list where each element is a fid
fid is a string
subsystems is a reference to a list where each element is a subsystem
subsystem is a string

</pre>

This is used only if the column containing the subsystem is not the last column.

=head2 Output Format

The standard output is a tab-delimited file. It consists of the input
file with extra columns added.

Input lines that cannot be extended are written to stderr.
