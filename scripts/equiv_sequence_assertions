=head1 equiv_sequence_assertions


Different groups have made assertions of function for numerous protein sequences.
The equiv_sequence_assertions allows the user to gather function assertions from
all of the sources.  Each assertion includes a field indicating whether the person making
the assertion viewed themself as an "expert".  The routine gathers assertions for all
proteins having identical protein sequence.


Example:

    equiv_sequence_assertions [arguments] < input > output

The standard input should be a tab-separated table (i.e., each line
is a tab-separated set of fields).  Normally, the last field in each
line would contain a protein identifier (i.e., an md5 value). 
If another column contains the md5s
use

    -c N

where N is the column (from 1) that contains the protein identifiers.

This is a pipe command. The input is taken from the standard input, and the
output is to the standard output.

=head2 Documentation for underlying call

This script is a wrapper for the CDMI-API call equiv_sequence_assertions. It is documented as follows:

  $return = $obj->equiv_sequence_assertions($proteins)

=over 4

=item Parameter and return types

=begin html

<pre>
$proteins is a proteins
$return is a reference to a hash where the key is a protein and the value is a function_assertions
proteins is a reference to a list where each element is a protein
protein is a string
function_assertions is a reference to a list where each element is a function_assertion
function_assertion is a reference to a list containing 4 items:
	0: an id
	1: a function
	2: a source
	3: an expert
id is a string
function is a string
source is a string
expert is a string

=item -c Column

This is used only if the column containing the md5s is not the last column.

=item -i InputFile    [ use InputFile, rather than stdin ]

=back

=head2 Output Format

The standard output is a tab-delimited file. It consists of the input
file with extra columns added (identifier,source,function,expert).

Input lines that cannot be extended are written to stderr.
