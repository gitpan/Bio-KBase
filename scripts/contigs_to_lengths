=head1 contigs_to_lengths


In some cases, one wishes to know just the lengths of the contigs, rather than their
actual DNA sequence (e.g., suppose that you wished to know if a gene boundary occured within
100 bp of the end of the contig).  To avoid requiring a user to access the entire DNA sequence,
we offer the ability to retrieve just the contig lengths.  Input to the routine is a list of contig IDs.
The routine returns a mapping from contig IDs to lengths


Example:

    contigs_to_lengths [arguments] < input > output

The standard input should be a tab-separated table (i.e., each line
is a tab-separated set of fields).  Normally, the last field in each
line would contain the identifer. If another column contains the identifier
use

    -c N

where N is the column (from 1) that contains the subsystem.

This is a pipe command. The input is taken from the standard input, and the
output is to the standard output.

=head2 Documentation for underlying call

This script is a wrapper for the CDMI-API call contigs_to_lengths. It is documented as follows:

  $return = $obj->contigs_to_lengths($contigs)

=over 4

=item Parameter and return types

=begin html

<pre>
$contigs is a contigs
$return is a reference to a hash where the key is a contig and the value is a length
contigs is a reference to a list where each element is a contig
contig is a string
length is an int

</pre>

=end html

=begin text

$contigs is a contigs
$return is a reference to a hash where the key is a contig and the value is a length
contigs is a reference to a list where each element is a contig
contig is a string

=item -c Column

This is used only if the column containing the subsystem is not the last column.

=item -i InputFile    [ use InputFile, rather than stdin ]

=back

=head2 Output Format

The standard output is a tab-delimited file. It consists of the input
file with an extra column (the contig length) added.

Input lines that cannot be extended are written to stderr.
