=head1 all_entities_ReactionRule

Return all instances of the ReactionRule entity.

A reaction rule represents the way a reaction takes place
within the context of a complex.

Example:

    all_entities_ReactionRule -a 

would retrieve all entities of type ReactionRule and include all fields
in the entities in the output.

=head2 Related entities

The ReactionRule entity has the following relationship links:

=over 4
    
=item HasProposedLocationIn Compartment

=item IsStepOf Complex

=item IsUseOf Reaction


=back


=head2 Command-Line Options

=over 4

=item -a

Return all fields.

=item -h

Display a list of the fields available for use.

=item -fields field-list

Choose a set of fields to return. Field-list is a comma-separated list of 
strings. The following fields are available:

=over 4

=item direction

=item transproton

=back    
   
=back

=head2 Output Format

The standard output is a tab-delimited file. It consists of the input
file with an extra column added for each requested field.  Input lines that cannot
be extended are written to stderr.
