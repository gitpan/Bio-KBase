=head1 query_entity_ContigChunk

Query the entity ContigChunk.

ContigChunks are strings of DNA thought of as being a string in a 4-character alphabet
with an associated ID.  We allow a broader alphabet that includes U (for RNA) and
the standard ambiguity characters.
The notion of ContigChunk was introduced to avoid transferring/manipulating
huge contigs to access small substrings.  A ContigSequence is formed by
concatenating a set of one or more ContigChunks.  Thus, ContigChunks are the
basic units moved from the database to memory.  Their existence should be
hidden from users in most circumstances (users are expected to request
substrings of ContigSequences, and the Kbase software locates the appropriate
ContigChunks).


Example:

    query_entity_ContigChunk -a 

=head2 Related entities

The ContigChunk entity has the following relationship links:

=over 4
    
=item IsSectionOf ContigSequence


=back


=head2 Command-Line Options

=over 4

=item -is field,value

Limit the results to entities where the given field has the given value.

=item -like field,value

Limit the results to entities where the given field is LIKE (in the sql sense) the given value.

=item -op operator,field,value

Limit the results to entities where the given field is related to the given value based on the given operator.

The operators supported are as follows. We provide text based alternatives to the comparison
operators so that extra quoting is not required to keep the command-line shell from 
confusing them with shell I/O redirection operators.

=over 4

=item < or lt

=item > or gt

=item <=  or le

=item >= or ge

=item =

=item LIKE

=back

=item -a

Return all fields.

=item -h

Display a list of the fields available for use.

=item -fields field-list

Choose a set of fields to return. Field-list is a comma-separated list of 
strings. The following fields are available:

=over 4

=item sequence

=back    
   
=back

=head2 Output Format

The standard output is a tab-delimited file containing a column
for each requested field.
