=head1 all_entities_Scenario

Return all instances of the Scenario entity.

A scenario is a partial instance of a subsystem with a
defined set of reactions. Each scenario converts input compounds to
output compounds using reactions. The scenario may use all of the
reactions controlled by a subsystem or only some, and may also
incorporate additional reactions. Because scenario names are not
unique, the actual scenario ID is a number.

Example:

    all_entities_Scenario -a 

would retrieve all entities of type Scenario and include all fields
in the entities in the output.

=head2 Related entities

The Scenario entity has the following relationship links:

=over 4
    
=item HasAsTerminus Compound

=item HasParticipant Reaction

=item Overlaps Diagram

=item Validates Subsystem


=back


=head2 Command-Line Options

=over 4

=item -a

Return all fields.

=item -h

Display a list of the fields available for use.

=item -fields field-list

Choose a set of fields to return. Field-list is a comma-separated list of 
strings. The following fields are available:

=over 4

=item common_name

=back    
   
=back

=head2 Output Format

The standard output is a tab-delimited file. It consists of the input
file with an extra column added for each requested field.  Input lines that cannot
be extended are written to stderr.
