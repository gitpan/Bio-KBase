=head1 all_entities_Annotation

Return all instances of the Annotation entity.

An annotation is a comment attached to a feature. Annotations
are used to track the history of a feature's functional assignments
and any related issues. The key is the feature ID followed by a
colon and a complemented ten-digit sequence number.


Example:

    all_entities_Annotation -a 

would retrieve all entities of type Annotation and include all fields
in the entities in the output.

=head2 Related entities

The Annotation entity has the following relationship links:

=over 4
    
=item Annotates Feature


=back


=head2 Command-Line Options

=over 4

=item -a

Return all fields.

=item -h

Display a list of the fields available for use.

=item -fields field-list

Choose a set of fields to return. Field-list is a comma-separated list of 
strings. The following fields are available:

=over 4

=item annotator

=item comment

=item annotation_time

=back    
   
=back

=head2 Output Format

The standard output is a tab-delimited file. It consists of the input
file with an extra column added for each requested field.  Input lines that cannot
be extended are written to stderr.
