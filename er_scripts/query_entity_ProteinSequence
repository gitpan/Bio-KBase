=head1 query_entity_ProteinSequence

Query the entity ProteinSequence.

We use the concept of ProteinSequence as an amino acid string with an associated
MD5 value.  It is easy to access the set of Features that relate to a ProteinSequence.
While function is still associated with Features (and may be for some time), publications
are associated with ProteinSequences (and the inferred impact on Features is through
the relationship connecting ProteinSequences to Features).


Example:

    query_entity_ProteinSequence -a 

=head2 Related entities

The ProteinSequence entity has the following relationship links:

=over 4
    
=item HasAssertedFunctionFrom Source

=item IsATopicOf Publication

=item IsAlignedBy AlignmentTree

=item IsProjectedOnto ProteinSequence

=item IsProteinFor Feature

=item IsProteinMemberOf Family

=item ProjectsOnto ProteinSequence

=head2 Command-Line Options

=over 4

=item -is field,value

Limit the results to entities where the given field has the given value.

=item -like field,value

Limit the results to entities where the given field is LIKE (in the sql sense) the given value.

=item -op operator,field,value

Limit the results to entities where the given field is related to the given value based on the given operator.

The operators supported are as follows. We provide text based alternatives to the comparison
operators so that extra quoting is not required to keep the command-line shell from 
confusing them with shell I/O redirection operators.

=over 4

=item < or lt

=item > or gt

=item <=  or le

=item >= or ge

=item =

=item LIKE

=back

=item -a

Return all fields.

=item -h

Display a list of the fields available for use.

=item -fields field-list

Choose a set of fields to return. Field-list is a comma-separated list of 
strings. The following fields are available:

=over 4

=item sequence

=back    
   
=back

=head2 Output Format

The standard output is a tab-delimited file containing a column
for each requested field.
