=head1 all_entities_ModelCompartment

Return all instances of the ModelCompartment entity.

The Model Compartment represents a section of a cell
(e.g. cell wall, cytoplasm) as it appears in a specific
model.

Example:

    all_entities_ModelCompartment -a 

would retrieve all entities of type ModelCompartment and include all fields
in the entities in the output.

=head2 Related entities

The ModelCompartment entity has the following relationship links:

=over 4
    
=item IsDivisionOf Model

=item IsInstanceOf Compartment

=item IsRealLocationOf Requirement

=item IsTargetOf BiomassCompound


=back


=head2 Command-Line Options

=over 4

=item -a

Return all fields.

=item -h

Display a list of the fields available for use.

=item -fields field-list

Choose a set of fields to return. Field-list is a comma-separated list of 
strings. The following fields are available:

=over 4

=item compartment_index

=item label

=item pH

=item potential

=back

=head2 Output Format

The standard output is a tab-delimited file. It consists of the input
file with an extra column added for each requested field.  Input lines that cannot
be extended are written to stderr.
