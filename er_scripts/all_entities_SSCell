=head1 all_entities_SSCell

Return all instances of the SSCell entity.

An SSCell (SpreadSheet Cell) represents a role as it occurs
in a subsystem spreadsheet row. The key is a colon-delimited triple
containing an MD5 hash of the subsystem ID followed by a genome ID
(with optional region string) and a role abbreviation.

Example:

    all_entities_SSCell -a 

would retrieve all entities of type SSCell and include all fields
in the entities in the output.

=head2 Related entities

The SSCell entity has the following relationship links:

=over 4
    
=item Contains Feature

=item HasRole Role

=item IsRoleFor SSRow


=back


=head2 Command-Line Options

=over 4

=item -a

Return all fields.

=item -h

Display a list of the fields available for use.

=item -fields field-list

Choose a set of fields to return. Field-list is a comma-separated list of 
strings. The following fields are available:

=head2 Output Format

The standard output is a tab-delimited file. It consists of the input
file with an extra column added for each requested field.  Input lines that cannot
be extended are written to stderr.
