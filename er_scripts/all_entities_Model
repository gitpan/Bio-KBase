=head1 all_entities_Model

Return all instances of the Model entity.

A model specifies a relationship between sets of features and
reactions in a cell. It is used to simulate cell growth and gene
knockouts to validate annotations.

Example:

    all_entities_Model -a 

would retrieve all entities of type Model and include all fields
in the entities in the output.

=head2 Related entities

The Model entity has the following relationship links:

=over 4
    
=item IsARequirementIn Requirement

=item IsDividedInto ModelCompartment

=item Manages Biomass

=item Models Genome


=back


=head2 Command-Line Options

=over 4

=item -a

Return all fields.

=item -h

Display a list of the fields available for use.

=item -fields field-list

Choose a set of fields to return. Field-list is a comma-separated list of 
strings. The following fields are available:

=over 4

=item mod_date

=item name

=item version

=item type

=item status

=item reaction_count

=item compound_count

=item annotation_count

=back

=head2 Output Format

The standard output is a tab-delimited file. It consists of the input
file with an extra column added for each requested field.  Input lines that cannot
be extended are written to stderr.
