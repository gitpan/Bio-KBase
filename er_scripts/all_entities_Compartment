=head1 all_entities_Compartment

Return all instances of the Compartment entity.

A compartment is a section of a single model that represents
the environment in which a reaction takes place (e.g. cell
wall).

Example:

    all_entities_Compartment -a 

would retrieve all entities of type Compartment and include all fields
in the entities in the output.

=head2 Related entities

The Compartment entity has the following relationship links:

=over 4
    
=item IsDefaultFor Reaction

=item IsDefaultLocationOf Reagent

=item IsInstantiatedBy ModelCompartment

=item IsProposedLocationOf ReactionRule


=back


=head2 Command-Line Options

=over 4

=item -a

Return all fields.

=item -h

Display a list of the fields available for use.

=item -fields field-list

Choose a set of fields to return. Field-list is a comma-separated list of 
strings. The following fields are available:

=over 4

=item abbr

=item mod_date

=item name

=item msid

=back

=head2 Output Format

The standard output is a tab-delimited file. It consists of the input
file with an extra column added for each requested field.  Input lines that cannot
be extended are written to stderr.
