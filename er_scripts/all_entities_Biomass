=head1 all_entities_Biomass

Return all instances of the Biomass entity.

A biomass is a collection of compounds in a specific
ratio and in specific compartments that are necessary for a
cell to function properly. The prediction of biomasses is key
to the functioning of the model.

Example:

    all_entities_Biomass -a 

would retrieve all entities of type Biomass and include all fields
in the entities in the output.

=head2 Related entities

The Biomass entity has the following relationship links:

=over 4
    
=item IsComprisedOf BiomassCompound

=item IsManagedBy Model


=back


=head2 Command-Line Options

=over 4

=item -a

Return all fields.

=item -h

Display a list of the fields available for use.

=item -fields field-list

Choose a set of fields to return. Field-list is a comma-separated list of 
strings. The following fields are available:

=over 4

=item mod_date

=item name

=back    
   
=back

=head2 Output Format

The standard output is a tab-delimited file. It consists of the input
file with an extra column added for each requested field.  Input lines that cannot
be extended are written to stderr.
