=head1 all_entities_Reagent

Return all instances of the Reagent entity.

This entity represents a compound as it is used by
a specific reaction. A reaction involves many compounds, and a
compound can be involved in many reactions. The reagent
describes the use of the compound by a specific reaction.

Example:

    all_entities_Reagent -a 

would retrieve all entities of type Reagent and include all fields
in the entities in the output.

=head2 Related entities

The Reagent entity has the following relationship links:

=over 4
    
=item HasDefaultLocation Compartment

=item IsInvolvedIn Reaction

=item IsParticipationOf Compound


=back


=head2 Command-Line Options

=over 4

=item -a

Return all fields.

=item -h

Display a list of the fields available for use.

=item -fields field-list

Choose a set of fields to return. Field-list is a comma-separated list of 
strings. The following fields are available:

=over 4

=item stoichiometry

=item cofactor

=item compartment_index

=item transport_coefficient

=back

=head2 Output Format

The standard output is a tab-delimited file. It consists of the input
file with an extra column added for each requested field.  Input lines that cannot
be extended are written to stderr.
